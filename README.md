# 🚨 Florian AI - Alert Dashboard

A real-time emergency alert dashboard for **Florian AI**, powered by a fine-tuned **Gemini 2.0 LLM**. An intelligent voice assistant designed to support **Texas A&M University (TAMU) Emergency Medical Services (EMS)**.

Florian AI helps EMS responders by analyzing emergency calls when they’re occupied, extracting critical information, and displaying it clearly and urgently to aid prioritization.
